# paw-apiblueprint-generator

A better API Blueprint Generator for Paw

The idea for this project is to take the great work that was done in [the original Paw API Blueprint Generator Extension](https://github.com/sumia01/Paw-APIBlueprintGenerator) and improve it to be spec compliant + allow importing to [Apiary.io](https://apiary.io) mainly to speed up my workflow when designing API Specifications.

## ðŸ”¥ Quick Start

 1. Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org). `Node > v8` with `npm > v5.6.0` are required for dev / building.
 2. Run `npm install` within the project root directory in Terminal to install dependencies.

## Issues

* As far as I can tell API Bueprint does not allow sub grouping, so all sub groups will be ignored
